## ðŸ“¥ Input Features (Predictors)

| Variable    | Description                                                    | Unit       |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| **PL (%)**  | Plastic Limit â€“ the water content at which soil begins to behave plastically | Percent (%) |
| **PI (%)**  | Plasticity Index â€“ PI = LL âˆ’ PL, indicates soil plasticity      | Percent (%) |
| **e0**      | Initial Void Ratio â€“ ratio of voids to solids before compression | Unitless    |
| **w (%)**   | Natural Water Content â€“ water content of the soil as sampled    | Percent (%) |

These variables are commonly used in predicting the compressibility of fine-grained soils.
